# Five Elements and Their Cycles

Below is a single sketch representing the Five Elements (Fire, Earth, Water, Air, and Space) and their interactions in both the Generative and Destructive Cycles:

                      |  Fire   |
                      +---------+

Generative Cycle: Fire → Earth → Water → Air → Space → Fire

Destructive Cycle:

                      +---------+
                      |  Fire   |
                      +---------+
                          ↘
                      +---------+
                      |  Air    |
                      +---------+
                          ↘
                      +---------+
                      |  Water  |
                      +---------+
                          ↘
                      +---------+
                      |  Space  |
                      +---------+
                          ↘
                      +---------+
                      |  Earth  |
                      +---------+
                          ↘
                      +---------+
                      |  Fire   |
                      +---------+

Destructive Cycle: Fire → Air → Water → Space → Earth → Fire
